# splunk-azure

!!Caveat!!
This is for proof-of-concept of building a simulation of Splunk clustering architecture by creating 13 ACIs (Azure Container Instances) in Azure Infrastructure. All ip addresses are external-facing and using Azure public DNS to resolve ip address, hence DO NOT ingest any sensitive data or production logs into the indexers.
